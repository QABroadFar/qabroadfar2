## Overview

The Quality Assurance Portal implements a structured workflow for managing Non-Conformance Product (NCP) reports. This document details the business processes, roles, and procedures that govern how quality issues are identified, reviewed, analyzed, and resolved within the organization.

### Purpose
- Ensure consistent handling of quality issues
- Provide accountability and traceability
- Facilitate continuous improvement
- Meet regulatory and compliance requirements
- Enable data-driven decision making

### Scope
This workflow applies to all manufacturing processes and products within the organization that require formal NCP reporting and resolution.

## NCP Report Lifecycle

The NCP Report Lifecycle consists of five sequential stages, each with specific requirements and deliverables:

```
Submission → QA Review → RCA Analysis → Process Review → Final Approval
    ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓
  Pending    Approved     Processed      Approved       Archived
              ↓            ↓              ↓
           Assigned to   Submitted      Forwarded
           Team Leader   for Review     to Manager
```

### Lifecycle States
1. **Pending**: Initial submission awaiting QA Leader review
2. **QA Approved**: Approved by QA Leader, assigned to Team Leader
