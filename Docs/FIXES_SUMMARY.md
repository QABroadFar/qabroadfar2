# Fixes Summary - Process Lead and QA Manager Rejection Workflow

Last Updated: September 6, 2025

## Issues Identified

1. **Process Lead Rejection Issue**: When a Process Lead rejected an NCP report, the system was incorrectly setting the status to 'qa_approved' but not properly clearing the process approval fields. This caused confusion in the workflow tracking and database display.

2. **QA Manager Rejection Issue**: Similarly, when a QA Manager rejected an NCP report, the system had the same issue with not properly clearing the approval fields.

3. **Missing Audit Trail**: The rejection actions were not being properly logged in the audit trail.

4. **Incomplete Notifications**: While notifications were being sent, they didn't include proper audit trail logging.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed rejectNCPByProcessLead Function (lib/database.ts)

**Before**: 
```typescript
const stmt = db.prepare(`
  UPDATE ncp_reports 
  SET status = 'qa_approved',
      process_approved_by = ?,
      process_approved_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      process_rejection_reason = ?
  WHERE id = ?
`)
```

**After**:
```typescript
const stmt = db.prepare(`
  UPDATE ncp_reports 
  SET status = 'qa_approved',
      process_approved_by = NULL,
      process_approved_at = NULL,
      process_rejection_reason = ?,
      process_comment = NULL
  WHERE id = ?
`)
```

**Additional Improvements**:
- Added audit trail logging using `logNCPChange` function
- Maintained proper notification system for Team Leaders

### 2. Fixed rejectNCPByQAManager Function (lib/database.ts)

**Before**: 
```typescript
const stmt = db.prepare(`
  UPDATE ncp_reports 
  SET status = 'qa_approved',
      manager_approved_by = ?,
      manager_approved_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      manager_rejection_reason = ?
  WHERE id = ?
`)
```

**After**:
```typescript
const stmt = db.prepare(`
  UPDATE ncp_reports 
  SET status = 'qa_approved',
      manager_approved_by = NULL,
      manager_approved_at = NULL,
      manager_rejection_reason = ?,
      manager_comment = NULL
  WHERE id = ?
`)
```

**Additional Improvements**:
- Added audit trail logging using `logNCPChange` function
- Maintained proper notification system for Team Leaders

### 3. Updated Documentation

Updated the following documentation files to reflect the current date and improvements:
- README.md
- COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md
- USER_GUIDE.md
- BUSINESS_WORKFLOW.md

### 4. Enhanced Documentation for Rejection Workflows

Updated the BUSINESS_WORKFLOW.md and USER_GUIDE.md to provide clearer information about:
- What happens when a Process Lead rejects an NCP
- What happens when a QA Manager rejects an NCP
- How rejection reasons are recorded and communicated
- The proper workflow status transitions during rejections

## Testing

The fixes have been tested to ensure:
1. ✅ Process Lead rejections properly clear approval fields
2. ✅ QA Manager rejections properly clear approval fields
3. ✅ Audit trail correctly logs rejection actions
4. ✅ Team Leaders receive notifications with rejection reasons
5. ✅ NCP status correctly transitions back to 'qa_approved'
6. ✅ Database displays correct information after rejections

## Impact

These fixes ensure that:
- The rejection workflow operates correctly
- All stakeholders receive proper notifications with rejection reasons
- The audit trail accurately reflects all actions
- Database displays accurate status and field information
- Team Leaders can easily identify and address rejected NCPs
