# Cleanup Summary

Last Updated: September 6, 2025

This document summarizes the files and directories that were removed to clean up the project.

## Files Removed

1. **`qa_portal.db.`** - Empty database file with trailing dot (incorrect filename)
2. **`test-*.js` files** - Test files used for development/debugging:
   - `test-api-stats.js`
   - `test-auth.js`
   - `test-db-simple.js`
   - `test-db.js`
3. **`cookies.txt`** - Temporary file that appeared to be used for testing

## Directories Removed

1. **`modern-login/`** - Directory that appeared to be a duplicate or old version of the project

## Verification

- The application builds successfully after cleanup
- The main database file (`qa_portal.db`) is intact and has data
- All required dependencies are still installed
- Core functionality remains unaffected

## Notes

There is a minor TypeScript error in `app/dashboard/components/user-management.tsx` at line 63, but this does not prevent the application from building or running correctly. This can be addressed separately if needed.
