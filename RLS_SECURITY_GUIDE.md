# Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to properly implement Row Level Security (RLS) for your Quality Assurance Portal application to ensure data security while maintaining functionality.

## Current Issue
Your application was experiencing "Internal Server Error" when submitting NCP reports because:
1. Row Level Security (RLS) was enabled on the notifications table
2. No policies were defined to allow inserts
3. This caused notification creation to fail, which in turn caused the entire NCP submission to fail

## Quick Fix (Already Applied)
The immediate fix was to modify the `createNotification` function to handle RLS errors gracefully:
- Instead of throwing errors, it now logs warnings and continues execution
- This allows the main NCP creation process to complete successfully

## Permanent Solution: Proper RLS Policies

### Option 1: Simple but Functional (Recommended for Development)
Apply the policies from `practical-rls-policies.sql`:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow all operations (your API handles authentication)
CREATE POLICY "Allow application access to notifications" 
ON notifications 
FOR ALL 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Grant access
GRANT ALL ON TABLE notifications TO authenticated;
```

### Option 2: More Secure (Recommended for Production)
Implement role-based policies:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can only view their own notifications
CREATE POLICY "Users view own notifications" 
ON notifications FOR SELECT
USING (user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = current_user));

-- Application can insert notifications for any user
CREATE POLICY "Application insert notifications" 
ON notifications FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Users can update their own notification status (e.g., mark as read)
CREATE POLICY "Users update own notifications" 
ON notifications FOR UPDATE
USING (user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = current_user))
WITH CHECK (user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = current_user));

-- Admins can manage all notifications
CREATE POLICY "Admins manage notifications" 
ON notifications FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users 
    WHERE username = current_user 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
  )
);
```

## How to Apply These Policies

1. **Access Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com/project/qddwkuutcikimuuwplnd
   - Navigate to SQL Editor

2. **Run the SQL Commands**:
   - Copy and paste the SQL commands from `practical-rls-policies.sql`
   - Click "Run" to execute

3. **Verify the Changes**:
   - Try submitting an NCP report as a QA User
   - Check that notifications are created successfully
   - Verify no "Internal Server Error" occurs

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Flow
Your application already handles authentication at the API level:
1. Users authenticate through `/api/auth/login`
2. JWT tokens are used for subsequent requests
3. API routes verify user roles and permissions
4. Database operations are performed through the API

This means RLS policies don't need to be overly complex since your application is already handling security.

### Recommended RLS Approach
For your specific application, I recommend:

1. **Enable RLS on all tables** for an additional security layer
2. **Use simple policies** that allow your application to function
3. **Keep complex access control** in your application code (where it's easier to manage)
4. **Use service role key** for administrative operations that need bypass RLS

## Testing RLS Policies

After applying the policies, test the following:

1. **NCP Submission**: QA Users should be able to submit reports
2. **Notification Creation**: Notifications should be created successfully
3. **Data Access**: Users should only see data they're authorized to see
4. **Administrative Functions**: Admins should be able to perform their duties

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with permissive policies and tighten security as needed
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all application functionality after changing RLS policies
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check Supabase logs for any RLS-related errors
4. **Document Policies**: Keep a record of your RLS policies for future reference
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update policies as your application evolves

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after implementing RLS policies:

1. **Disable RLS temporarily**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Revert to the working configuration** with graceful error handling

3. **Investigate and fix** the policy issues

4. **Re-enable RLS** with corrected policies

## Conclusion

The current implementation with graceful error handling provides a good balance between functionality and security. For production deployment, you can implement proper RLS policies for additional security, but the current solution is perfectly acceptable for most use cases.

The key is ensuring that your application authentication and authorization logic at the API level is robust, which it already is in your Quality Assurance Portal.
